<h1>Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)</h1>
<p>* It is a technique that helps developers interact with a database using the programming language they are using in their code (like Java, Python, or C#).</p>
<p>* Instead of writing SQL queries directly, developers can work with objects in their code</p>
<p>* And the ORM framework takes care of translating those objects into the database language (SQL) and vice versa.</p>
<h3>Example:- Imagine you have an object in your code representing a "User.</h3>
<p>* With ORM, you can save this user object to a database without having to write explicit SQL queries.</p>
<p>* The ORM framework handles the translation between your code's objects and the database's tables.</p>
<h1>Hibernate Frameworke</h1>
<p>* Hibernate is an ORM framework that allows developers to interact with a database using Java objects.</p>
<p>* Hibernate is an open-source, lightweight ORM tool that is used to develop Java applications to interact with the database.</p>
